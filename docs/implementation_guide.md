## Project Structure Overview

Before diving into the implementation phases, let's establish a clear project structure that will guide our development process. We'll use a monorepo architecture to facilitate code sharing between frontend and backend while maintaining clear boundaries between different system components.

### Understanding the Directory Structure in Detail

To help developers navigate this project effectively, let's explore what belongs in each directory. Think of this structure as organizing a large construction project where different teams need to find their tools and materials quickly.

The **deskie/** root folder is the main entrance to our project, containing all code and configuration files. This is where developers start when they clone the repository.

Within the **packages/** directory, we organize our code into three main areas. The **packages/backend/** folder houses all server-side code - think of it as the foundation and support structure of a building. While users don't see it directly, it handles all the heavy lifting. Inside, the app/ subdirectory contains the running code. The api/ folder specifically handles incoming network requests - when a user clicks "Create Interview," the request routes to a file here for processing. The services/ folder implements core business logic like "how to generate interview questions" or "how to evaluate answers." The models/ folder defines data structures, much like architectural blueprints, specifying what information an interview should contain or how candidate profiles should be stored. Finally, the utils/ folder contains utility functions that multiple modules might need, such as date formatting or string processing tools.

The **packages/frontend/** directory contains all user interface code - this is like the interior design and facade of our building. Within src/pages/, each file typically corresponds to a user-visible page such as login, interview creation, or results viewing. The components/ folder houses reusable UI elements like buttons, input fields, and charts - standardized parts that can be used across different pages. The hooks/ folder stores custom React hooks, which are reusable logic pieces for functions like "fetch current user information" or "auto-save form data." The lib/ folder contains code for backend communication and other utility functions.

The **packages/shared/** folder serves as a bridge between frontend and backend. It primarily stores TypeScript type definitions, ensuring both ends share the same understanding of data structures. For example, when we define that "an interview question should contain question text, scoring criteria, and reference answers," this definition lives in the shared folder, preventing any misunderstandings between teams.

The **infrastructure/** directory contains all deployment-related configurations - like the plumbing and electrical blueprints of a house. The docker/ subdirectory holds Docker configuration files that define how to package our application into containers that can run on any server. The k8s/ subdirectory contains Kubernetes configurations describing how to run and manage our application in production, including handling high traffic and automatic scaling.

The **docs/** folder serves as the project's documentation center - the comprehensive manual for our house. This should include API documentation (explaining how other developers can call our interfaces), architecture design documents (explaining system design decisions), deployment guides (detailing installation and operation procedures), and more. Good documentation acts like a detailed manual, helping new team members understand the project quickly.

Finally, the **docker-compose.yml** file in the root directory is a special configuration file defining how to set up the development environment. With this file, new developers can run a single command to establish a complete development environment on their machines, including all dependent services like databases and caches. It's like a one-click "model home" ensuring every developer works in an identical environment.

This directory structure follows the principle of "separation of concerns" - each folder has clear responsibilities, related code stays together, and unrelated code remains isolated. This approach makes it easy to locate code when modifying features, reduces conflicts when multiple developers work simultaneously, and maintains clarity as the project grows. Understanding this structure gives you a map of the project, allowing you to quickly navigate to any code you need to modify or review.




## Implementation Timeline Overview

The entire MVP development is structured into six weeks of focused development, with each phase building upon the previous one. This approach allows us to deliver value incrementally while maintaining flexibility to adapt based on learnings from each phase.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Infrastructure

### Objectives

The first week focuses on establishing a robust foundation that will support all subsequent development. This includes setting up the development environment, establishing coding standards, and creating the basic application skeleton.

### Backend Setup

The backend team will initialize a FastAPI application with proper project structure and dependency management. FastAPI was chosen for its excellent performance characteristics, automatic API documentation generation, and strong typing support that aligns well with our monorepo architecture.

Key tasks include setting up the database layer using SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL as our primary datastore. The database schema should be designed with flexibility in mind, utilizing JSON columns for storing variable interview configurations and evaluation results. This approach allows us to iterate on our data structures without frequent schema migrations.

The team should also establish a Redis instance for caching and session management. Redis will be crucial for storing temporary data during interviews and caching expensive AI model responses to reduce costs.

### Frontend Setup

The frontend team will bootstrap a Next.js application with TypeScript enabled. Next.js provides an excellent developer experience with features like server-side rendering and API routes that we can leverage for optimal performance.

The initial setup should include configuration of some CSS tool for styling. Additionally, setting up Framer Motion for animations will ensure smooth transitions that enhance the user experience during interviews.

### Development Environment

Both teams should collaborate on setting up Docker Compose configurations that provide a consistent development environment. This setup should include all necessary services (PostgreSQL, Redis) and support hot reloading for both frontend and backend code.

## Phase 2: Core AI Integration

### Objectives

This phase focuses on implementing the heart of our system: the AI-powered interview generation and evaluation capabilities. The goal is to create a flexible, maintainable system that can generate high-quality, personalized interview questions based on job requirements and candidate profiles.

### AI Service Architecture

The backend team will implement an abstraction layer for Monica AI services that allows easy switching between different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, or self-hosted models). This abstraction should handle common concerns like retry logic, error handling, and response parsing.

The service layer should implement a robust prompt engineering system. Rather than hardcoding prompts throughout the application, create a centralized prompt management system that allows for versioning and A/B testing of different prompt strategies.

### Thought Chain Generation

The thought chain represents our system's understanding of what makes a good candidate for a specific position. The implementation should focus on generating comprehensive evaluation frameworks that consider multiple dimensions of candidate assessment.

The system needs to parse job descriptions intelligently, extracting not just technical requirements but also soft skills, team dynamics, and company culture factors. This parsing should be resilient to various job description formats and styles.

### Question Generation Pipeline

Building on the thought chain, the question generation system should create personalized questions that effectively evaluate candidates against the identified competencies. The system should maintain a balance between standardization (for fair comparison) and personalization (for relevant assessment).

Each generated question should include not just the question text but also evaluation criteria, expected answer components, and follow-up questions. This metadata will be crucial for the evaluation phase.

### Caching Strategy

Implement a multi-level caching strategy to optimize costs and performance. Cache similar job descriptions' thought chains, frequently used question templates, and common evaluation patterns. Use Redis with appropriate TTL values to ensure cached data remains fresh.

- [Redis Caching Patterns](https://redis.io/docs/manual/patterns/)

## Phase 3: Evaluation System

### Objectives

The evaluation system transforms candidate responses into actionable insights for hiring managers. This phase focuses on building a fair, transparent, and comprehensive evaluation pipeline.

### Multi-dimensional Evaluation

Implement evaluators for different competency dimensions such as technical accuracy, communication clarity, problem-solving approach, and cultural fit. Each evaluator should operate independently and provide detailed justification for its scores.

The evaluation system should adapt to the seniority level of the position and the candidate's experience. A junior developer's response should be evaluated differently from a senior architect's, even for similar questions.

### Relative Scoring System

Rather than relying solely on absolute scores, implement a percentile-based ranking system that compares candidates against others who interviewed for similar positions. This approach provides more meaningful insights and helps account for varying question difficulty.

Build a score pooling mechanism that aggregates historical evaluation data while respecting data privacy. Use statistical methods to identify outliers and ensure score distributions remain calibrated over time.

### Explainability Features

Every evaluation should be accompanied by clear explanations that hiring managers can understand and trust. Implement a system that highlights which parts of a candidate's answer contributed positively or negatively to their score.

Create evaluation reports that balance comprehensiveness with readability. Use visualizations where appropriate but ensure all insights are also available in text form for accessibility.

## Phase 4: User Interface Development

### Objectives

Create intuitive interfaces for both hiring managers and candidates that minimize friction while maximizing the value delivered by our AI system.

### Hiring Manager Interface

The interface should follow a principle of progressive disclosure, showing only essential information upfront while making advanced features easily discoverable. The job creation flow should be optimized for the most common use case: pasting a job posting URL and letting the system handle the rest.

Implement intelligent defaults based on job type, company size, and industry. These defaults should be easily overridable but good enough that many users won't need to change them.

The results dashboard should present candidate evaluations in a scannable format, with clear visual hierarchies that guide attention to the most important information. Use data visualization judiciously, ensuring each chart or graph provides genuine insight rather than mere decoration.

### Candidate Interface

The interview experience should feel professional yet approachable. Implement a clean, distraction-free interface that helps candidates focus on providing their best answers. Include progress indicators and time suggestions to help candidates pace themselves.

Consider accessibility from the start. Ensure the interface works well with screen readers, supports keyboard navigation, and provides options for candidates who may need accommodations.

### Real-time Features

Implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates during interviews. This allows hiring managers to monitor ongoing interviews and enables features like dynamic question adjustment based on previous answers.

## Phase 5: Integration and Testing

### Objectives

Ensure all components work together seamlessly and the system meets quality standards for production deployment.

### Testing Strategy

Implement comprehensive test suites at multiple levels. Unit tests should cover individual functions and components, focusing on edge cases and error conditions. Integration tests should verify that different system components communicate correctly.

For the AI components, create test fixtures that represent various job types and candidate profiles. These fixtures help ensure consistent behavior as the system evolves.

```python
# Example of a test fixture for AI evaluation
@pytest.fixture
def sample_interview_context():
    return {
        "job_type": "senior_frontend_engineer",
        "company_context": {"size": "startup", "culture": "fast-paced"},
        "evaluation_criteria": {
            "technical_depth": 0.4,
            "system_design": 0.3,
            "communication": 0.3
        }
    }

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_evaluation_consistency(sample_interview_context, ai_evaluator):
    # Test that similar answers receive similar scores
    answer1 = "I would use React Context for state management..."
    answer2 = "My approach would involve React Context for managing state..."
    
    score1 = await ai_evaluator.evaluate(answer1, sample_interview_context)
    score2 = await ai_evaluator.evaluate(answer2, sample_interview_context)
    
    assert abs(score1.total - score2.total) < 0.1  # Scores should be within 10%
```

### Performance Testing

Use tools like Locust or K6 to simulate realistic load patterns. Test scenarios should include concurrent interview sessions, bulk question generation, and simultaneous result viewing by multiple hiring managers.

Establish performance baselines and set up monitoring to detect degradation over time. Pay special attention to AI API response times and implement appropriate timeouts and fallback mechanisms.

### Security Audit

Conduct a security review focusing on data privacy, authentication, and authorization. Ensure all candidate data is properly encrypted at rest and in transit. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of expensive AI operations.

### Deployment Preparation

Create Docker containers for all services and test them in an environment that closely mimics production. Set up CI/CD pipelines that automatically run tests and build containers when code is merged.

Document deployment procedures and create runbooks for common operational tasks. Ensure both frontend and backend teams understand how to monitor and troubleshoot the deployed system.

- [Docker Best Practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/dev-best-practices/)

## Critical Success Factors

### Code Quality and Maintainability

Establish clear coding standards early and enforce them through automated tools. Use linters, formatters, and type checkers to catch issues before they reach code review. Regular refactoring sessions help prevent technical debt accumulation.

### Communication and Documentation

Maintain clear communication channels between frontend and backend teams. Daily standups during the implementation phase help identify integration issues early. Document key decisions and architectural choices as you make them, not as an afterthought.

### Monitoring and Observability

Build observability into the system from the start. Implement structured logging that makes debugging production issues straightforward. Set up metrics collection for both technical performance and business KPIs.

### User Feedback Integration

Plan for rapid iteration based on user feedback. Implement feature flags that allow gradual rollout of new capabilities. Create feedback channels that make it easy for users to report issues and suggest improvements.

## Risk Mitigation

The primary technical risk is AI response inconsistency. Mitigate this through comprehensive prompt testing, response validation, and fallback mechanisms. Always have a plan for graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable.

Cost management is crucial given the expense of AI API calls. Implement strict budgeting controls and alerts for unusual usage patterns. Use caching aggressively but intelligently, ensuring cached responses remain relevant.

Data privacy and security cannot be an afterthought. Regular security reviews, penetration testing, and compliance audits should be built into the development schedule. Consider engaging external security experts for critical reviews.

## Conclusion

This engineering implementation plan provides a structured approach to building Deskie's MVP in six weeks. Success depends on clear communication, disciplined execution, and maintaining focus on delivering core value to users. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a solid foundation for future enhancement and scaling.

The modular architecture and comprehensive testing strategy ensure the system can evolve based on user needs while maintaining reliability. By following this plan, both frontend and backend teams can work efficiently toward our common goal of revolutionizing the technical recruitment process.
